# Function
This is a programming has two functions:
one is for converting a fasta file to a genbank file;
another one is to extract the 'id' and 'sequence' of DNA or protein from a fasta file and then organize them into one csv file.
# Direction
Open Ternimal
if you want to get a genbank file
e.g. type: python3 coursework.py filename.fasta gbk
then you will get a file named test_gb
if you want to get a csv file
e.g. type: python3 coursework.py filename.fasta csv
then you will get a file named test_csv
if you want to get both a genbank file and a csv file
e.g. type: python3 coursework.py filename.fasta gbk and csv
